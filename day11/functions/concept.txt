Functions:
are used to reuse the code


syntax:

Two way:

First way:
function fun_name(){



}

Second way:

fun_name() {


}


Scope of a variable:

by default all variables are global variables
To make any variable as local use local keyword.
ex; local x=4  (we need to define local variables only inside a fun)




Note: We need to define called funtion before calling function in scripting laguage.
